Java keywords are also known as reserved words. Keywords are particular words that act as a key to a code. These are predefined words by Java so they cannot be used as a variable or object name or class name.

## Understanding Java Keywords with Example

**Java keywords** are reserved words that have a predefined meaning in the Java language and cannot be used as identifiers such as variable names, class names, or method names.

### Example

Consider the following example to understand how Java keywords are used in a program.

[](https://www.tpointtech.com/java-keywords#)[](https://www.tpointtech.com/java-keywords#)[](https://www.tpointtech.com/java-keywords#)

1. public class Demo {  
2.     public static void main(String[] args) {  
3.         int number = 10;  
4.         if (number > 5) {  
5.             System.out.println("Number is greater than 5");  
6.         }  
7.     }  
8. }  

**Output:**

Number is greater than 5

### Explanation:

In the above example, words like **public**, **class**, **static**, **void**, **int**, and **if** are Java keywords. Each keyword has a special purpose defined by Java. For instance,

- **class** is used to declare a class
- **int** is used to define an integer variable, and
- **if** is used for conditional execution.
