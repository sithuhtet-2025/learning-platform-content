Java Programming Examples

Java programs are frequently asked in interviews and examinations. These programs are commonly based on topics such as control statements, [array](https://www.tpointtech.com/array-in-java), [string](https://www.tpointtech.com/java-string), and [object-oriented programming concepts](https://www.tpointtech.com/java-oops-concepts). Basic Java programs like Fibonacci series, prime number, factorial, and palindrome are among the most commonly asked. All the Java programs are explained with appropriate examples and outputs. Beginners are advised to study the [Java tutorial](https://www.tpointtech.com/java-tutorial) before practicing these programs. The following section presents a list of Java programs.
