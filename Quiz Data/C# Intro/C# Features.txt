It manages memory, thread execution, code safety verification, compilation (JIT), and other critical system services.');

It runs periodically on a separate background thread to detect and free memory used by objects that are no longer reachable by the application, preventing memory leaks.');

('C# Features', 'Introduced in C# 3.0, which feature provides a consistent, SQL-like declarative syntax to query and manipulate data directly within C#?', 'Entity Framework', 'ADO.NET', 'LINQ (Language Integrated Query)', 'Lambda Expressions', 'C', 'LINQ integrates powerful querying capabilities directly into the C# language. It allows developers to write expressive, type-safe queries against any collection that implements IEnumerable or IQueryable (like databases, XML, or arrays).');

INSERT INTO Quizzes (LessonTitle, QuestionText, OptionA, OptionB, OptionC, OptionD, CorrectAnswer, Explanation) VALUES 
('C# Features', 'What significant feature, introduced in C# 5.0, drastically simplified asynchronous programming by letting developers write non-blocking code that looks synchronous?', 'The Task Parallel Library (TPL)', 'The async and await keywords', 'BackgroundWorker components', 'Multithreading and Mutexes', 'B', 'The ''async'' and ''await'' keywords revolutionized C# by allowing developers to write asynchronous code in a linear, readable fashion. The compiler automatically handles the complex state machine generation behind the scenes to free up the calling thread.');

INSERT INTO Quizzes (LessonTitle, QuestionText, OptionA, OptionB, OptionC, OptionD, CorrectAnswer, Explanation) VALUES 
('C# Features', 'C# is widely known as a "strongly-typed" language. What does this fundamentally mean?', 'Every variable must be defined as a string before conversion.', 'Variables can dynamically change their data type at runtime without restriction.', 'Every variable and expression has a strict type known at compile time, preventing implicit conversions that result in data loss or errors.', 'It only supports primitive value types and not custom objects.', 'C', 'Strong typing ensures strict type safety. The C# compiler rigorously verifies that the types of variables, arguments, and return values match expected types, catching potential mismatch errors during compilation rather than crashing at runtime.');

INSERT INTO Quizzes (LessonTitle, QuestionText, OptionA, OptionB, OptionC, OptionD, CorrectAnswer, Explanation) VALUES

The compiler strictly tracks null states and issues warnings if a potentially null reference is dereferenced unsafely.');

INSERT INTO Quizzes (LessonTitle, QuestionText, OptionA, OptionB, OptionC, OptionD, CorrectAnswer, Explanation) VALUES 
('C# Features', 'Which modern C# feature allows you to elegantly test an expression to determine if it has a certain structural shape or type, and extract data from it simultaneously?', 'Exception Handling', 'Reflection', 'Pattern Matching', 'Polymorphism', 'C', 'Pattern matching allows you to test whether an object has a specific shape or type and safely extract values into local variables in a single, concise expression. It is heavily utilized in modern ''switch'' expressions and ''is'' statements.');

('C# Features', 'Introduced in C# 9.0, what keyword is used to declare a specialized type designed specifically for encapsulating immutable data while providing built-in value-based equality?', 'struct', 'class', 'record', 'tuple', 'C', 'The ''record'' keyword creates a reference type that provides synthesized methods for value equality (like structs) but still supports inheritance (like classes). They are the modern architectural standard for creating immutable data models and Data Transfer Objects (DTOs).');
