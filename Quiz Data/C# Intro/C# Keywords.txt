They have specific semantic meanings to the C# compiler and cannot be used as names for variables, classes, or other user-defined identifiers under normal circumstances.');

('C# Keywords', 'If you absolutely must use a C# reserved keyword (such as ''class'' or ''string'') as a variable or property name, how can you force the compiler to accept it as a valid identifier?', 'By wrapping the keyword in square brackets (e.g., [class]).', 'By wrapping the keyword in double quotes (e.g., "class").', 'By prefixing the keyword with an at symbol (e.g., @class).', 'It is strictly impossible to use a reserved keyword as an identifier in C#.', 'C', 'Prefixing a reserved keyword with the @ symbol tells the C# compiler to treat it as a standard identifier rather than a language keyword. This is particularly useful when interfacing with APIs or code written in other languages that might not share the same reserved words.');

INSERT INTO Quizzes (LessonTitle, QuestionText, OptionA, OptionB, OptionC, OptionD, CorrectAnswer, Explanation) VALUES 
('C# Keywords', 'What is a "contextual keyword" in C#?', 'A keyword that only works within specific namespaces.', 'A keyword that changes its behavior based on the operating system.', 'A word that acts as a keyword only in specific code contexts, but can be safely used as a normal identifier anywhere else without the @ prefix.', 'A keyword that is obsolete and only maintained for backward compatibility.', 'C', 'Contextual keywords (like ''var'', ''yield'', ''from'', or ''value'') are not globally reserved. The compiler treats them as keywords only when they appear in a specific syntactic location (like ''var'' in a variable declaration), allowing them to be used as normal variable names elsewhere without conflicts.');

INSERT INTO Quizzes (LessonTitle, QuestionText, OptionA, OptionB, OptionC, OptionD, CorrectAnswer, Explanation) VALUES 
('C# Keywords', 'Which of the following keywords is used to define a reference type blueprint that supports both inheritance and polymorphism?', 'struct', 'enum', 'class', 'delegate', 'C', 'The ''class'' keyword is used to define a reference type. Unlike ''struct'' (which defines a value type that does not support inheritance), classes are the foundational building blocks for object-oriented programming features like inheritance and polymorphism.');

INSERT INTO Quizzes (LessonTitle, QuestionText, OptionA, OptionB, OptionC, OptionD, CorrectAnswer, Explanation) VALUES 
('C# Keywords', 'Which control flow keyword is used to immediately terminate the execution of the closest enclosing loop (like `for` or `while`) and transfer control to the next statement outside the loop?', 'continue', 'return', 'exit', 'break', 'D', 'The ''break'' keyword abruptly terminates the innermost loop or switch statement it is placed inside. The ''continue'' keyword skips the rest of the current iteration and starts the next one, while ''return'' exits the entire method.');

('C# Keywords', 'Which modifier keyword is used to specify that a field can only be assigned a value during its declaration or within the constructor of the same class, making it immutable thereafter?', 'const', 'readonly', 'sealed', 'static', 'B', 'The ''readonly'' keyword ensures a field can only be assigned during initialization or inside a constructor. Note that ''const'' also prevents modification, but ''const'' requires the value to be known strictly at compile-time, whereas ''readonly'' values can be calculated dynamically at runtime during instantiation.');

('C# Keywords', 'Which keyword is used to explicitly destroy an object and return its memory to the system immediately in C#?', 'delete', 'free', 'dispose', 'None of the above', 'D', 'C# does not have a keyword to explicitly destroy an object or free managed memory in the way C++ uses ''delete''. Memory management is handled automatically by the Garbage Collector in the background. (While the IDisposable.Dispose() method exists to release unmanaged resources, ''dispose'' itself is not a C# language keyword).');

INSERT INTO Quizzes (LessonTitle, QuestionText, OptionA, OptionB, OptionC, OptionD, CorrectAnswer, Explanation) VALUES 
('C# Keywords', 'What does the ''typeof'' keyword do in C#?', 'It returns the string name of a variable''s type.', 'It obtains the System.Type metadata object for a specified data type at compile-time.', 'It checks if an object is compatible with a specific type at runtime.', 'It dynamically changes the type of a variable.', 'B', 'The ''typeof'' operator takes a type name (like typeof(int) or typeof(MyClass)) and returns the corresponding System.Type metadata object. It is strictly evaluated at compile-time, making it highly efficient, unlike the GetType() method which evaluates an instantiated object instance dynamically at runtime.');
