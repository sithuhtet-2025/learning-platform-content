('C# Sealed', 'What is the primary effect of applying the ''sealed'' keyword to a class in C#?', 'It prevents the class from being instantiated.', 'It prevents other classes from inheriting from it.', 'It makes all members of the class static.', 'It hides the class from other namespaces.', 'B', 'When applied to a class, the ''sealed'' modifier prevents any other class from inheriting from it. This is often used to ensure that a class''s behavior cannot be altered via inheritance.');

INSERT INTO Quizzes (LessonTitle, QuestionText, OptionA, OptionB, OptionC, OptionD, CorrectAnswer, Explanation) VALUES 
('C# Sealed', 'How is the ''sealed'' keyword used in the context of methods and properties?', 'To prevent a virtual method from being overridden in any further derived classes.', 'To prevent a method from being called outside its own class.', 'To make a method execute synchronously.', 'To force derived classes to override the method.', 'A', 'When applied to a method or property, ''sealed'' must always be used in combination with ''override''. It prevents classes further down the inheritance hierarchy from overriding that specific member again.');

INSERT INTO Quizzes (LessonTitle, QuestionText, OptionA, OptionB, OptionC, OptionD, CorrectAnswer, Explanation) VALUES 
('C# Sealed', 'Is it possible to mark a brand-new virtual method in a base class as ''sealed'' directly?', 'Yes, it perfectly encapsulates the base method.', 'No, a method must first be an ''override'' of an inherited virtual method before it can be sealed.', 'Yes, but only if the base class is also marked as sealed.', 'Yes, but it requires the ''unsafe'' keyword.', 'B', 'You cannot seal a method at the point of its original virtual declaration. The ''sealed'' modifier can only be applied to a method or property that is actively overriding a virtual member from a parent class.');

('C# Sealed', 'Which of the following built-in C# types is implicitly sealed and cannot be inherited from?', 'System.Exception', 'System.Object', 'System.String', 'System.Collections.ArrayList', 'C', 'System.String is a sealed class in the .NET framework. This is a crucial security and performance design choice to ensure strings remain strictly immutable and their behavior cannot be hijacked via inheritance.');

INSERT INTO Quizzes (LessonTitle, QuestionText, OptionA, OptionB, OptionC, OptionD, CorrectAnswer, Explanation) VALUES 
('C# Sealed', 'What happens if you attempt to define a class with both the ''abstract'' and ''sealed'' modifiers simultaneously?', 'The class compiles but cannot be instantiated.', 'The class acts as a static class.', 'A compile-time error occurs.', 'The compiler ignores the ''sealed'' modifier.', 'C', 'The ''abstract'' and ''sealed'' modifiers are mutually exclusive. An abstract class requires inheritance to provide implementation, whereas a sealed class strictly forbids inheritance. Combining them results in a compiler error.');

('C# Sealed', 'Which of the following data structures in C# is implicitly sealed by default?', 'Classes', 'Interfaces', 'Structs (Value Types)', 'Delegates', 'C', 'In C#, all structs (value types) are implicitly sealed. You cannot inherit from a struct, nor can a struct inherit from another struct or class (though it can implement interfaces).');

INSERT INTO Quizzes (LessonTitle, QuestionText, OptionA, OptionB, OptionC, OptionD, CorrectAnswer, Explanation) VALUES 
('C# Sealed', 'Aside from preventing inheritance, what is a secondary benefit of marking a class as ''sealed'' in C#?', 'It allows the class to use multiple inheritance.', 'It can provide slight runtime performance optimizations because the CLR can resolve method calls non-virtually.', 'It automatically makes all class fields readonly.', 'It prevents the class from being garbage collected.', 'B', 'When a class is sealed, the .NET JIT compiler knows that no derived classes can exist. This allows it to safely optimize virtual method calls into direct non-virtual calls, potentially improving runtime performance.');

INSERT INTO Quizzes (LessonTitle, QuestionText, OptionA, OptionB, OptionC, OptionD, CorrectAnswer, Explanation) VALUES 
('C# Sealed', 'Can the ''sealed'' keyword be applied to individual fields or local variables within a method?', 'Yes, it makes them immutable constants.', 'No, it can only be applied to classes, methods, properties, events, and indexers.', 'Yes, but only if they are primitive types like int or bool.', 'Yes, but it requires C# 10 or later.', 'B', 'The ''sealed'' modifier is strictly structural. It controls inheritance and overriding. It cannot be applied to fields or local variables; to make those immutable, you would use ''readonly'' or ''const''.');
