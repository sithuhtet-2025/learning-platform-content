('C# Encapsulation', 'Why is it considered a poor architectural practice to declare class data fields as `public` in C#?', 'Public fields execute slower than private fields.', 'It breaks encapsulation by allowing external code to change internal state without validation, potentially leaving the object in an invalid or unstable state.', 'Public fields cannot be accessed across different namespaces.', 'The C# compiler automatically converts public fields to protected fields at runtime.', 'B', 'Exposing public fields violates encapsulation because it removes the class''s ability to control, validate, or react to changes in its own data.

It permits the property to be mutated during the object''s creation phase (like in a `{ Name = "John" }` initializer), but physically prevents any further mutation once initialization is complete.');
