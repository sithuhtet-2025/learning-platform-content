Unlike Composition, where the child''s lifecycle is strictly bound to the parent, in Aggregation, the child object (e.g., a Professor) can continue to exist even if the parent object (e.g., a Department) is disposed of.');

If deleting the Library does not delete the Books, what type of relationship is this?', 'Inheritance', 'Composition', 'Aggregation', 'Encapsulation', 'C', 'Because the Book objects have an independent existence and are merely referenced by the Library, this is a classic example of Aggregation. If deleting the Library also destroyed the Books, it would be Composition.');

('C# Aggregation (HAS-A Relationship)', 'Why is Aggregation often preferred over Inheritance in modern software design?', 'It allows for multiple inheritance, which C# doesn''t support through classes.', 'It promotes loose coupling and allows objects to be swapped or reused more flexibly.', 'It makes the code execute faster by avoiding virtual method tables.', 'It automatically handles memory management through the garbage collector.', 'B', 'The principle of ''Composition/Aggregation over Inheritance'' suggests that building systems by combining simple objects leads to more maintainable and flexible code than creating complex, rigid inheritance hierarchies.');

The Employee instance is owned by the calling code and can be associated with multiple different objects or persist after the Manager is gone.');
