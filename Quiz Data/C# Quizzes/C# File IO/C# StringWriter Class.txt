It allows you to generate a string payload dynamically using the exact same methods you would use to write to a physical file or network stream.');

('C# StringWriter Class', 'From an architectural perspective, if `StringWriter` just wraps a `StringBuilder`, why would a developer choose to use `StringWriter` instead of using `StringBuilder` directly?', '`StringWriter` executes significantly faster.', '`StringWriter` uses less memory than a raw `StringBuilder`.', 'To achieve polymorphism when interfacing with a third-party API or framework class (like `XmlSerializer`) that strictly demands a `TextWriter` parameter.', '`StringWriter` automatically encrypts the data.', 'C', 'The primary power of `StringWriter` is its polymorphism.
