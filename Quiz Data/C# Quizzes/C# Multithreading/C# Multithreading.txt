This is essential for executing heavy background calculations without freezing the Main/UI thread.');

However, once all foreground threads complete, the CLR forcefully shuts down all active background threads and exits the application.');

It forces the calling thread (in this case, the Main Thread) to halt execution and wait for the target thread to terminate, ensuring sequential dependency resolution.');

The `ThreadPool` maintains a queue of worker threads that sleep when idle and wake up to process tasks.
