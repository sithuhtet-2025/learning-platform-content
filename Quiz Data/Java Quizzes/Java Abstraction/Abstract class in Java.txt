('Abstract class in Java', 'Can an abstract class in Java contain a constructor?', 'No, because abstract classes cannot be instantiated.', 'Yes, but the constructor must also be declared as ''abstract''.', 'Yes, constructors are allowed and are called when a concrete subclass is instantiated.', 'Yes, but they can only be no-argument (default) constructors.', 'C', 'Abstract classes can have constructors. Even though you cannot instantiate the abstract class directly, its constructor is called via ''super()'' when a concrete subclass is instantiated.');

This is often used to simply prevent direct instantiation of a base class.');
