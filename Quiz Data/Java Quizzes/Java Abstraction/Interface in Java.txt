('Interface in Java', 'In Java (prior to Java 8), what were the implicit modifiers for any method declared inside an interface without a body?', 'protected abstract', 'public abstract', 'private final', 'static abstract', 'B', 'By default, any method declared in an interface without a body is implicitly ''public'' and ''abstract''. You do not need to explicitly write these keywords.');

INSERT INTO Quizzes (LessonTitle, QuestionText, OptionA, OptionB, OptionC, OptionD, CorrectAnswer, Explanation) VALUES 
('Interface in Java', 'What is the purpose of a ''default'' method introduced in Java 8 interfaces?', 'To provide a fallback value for an uninitialized interface constant.', 'To restrict a method so it cannot be overridden by implementing classes.', 'To allow an interface to provide a concrete method implementation without breaking existing classes that implement the interface.', 'To define a method that is automatically called when the interface is loaded into memory.', 'C', 'Default methods allow adding new methods with implementations to interfaces. This ensures backward compatibility, as existing implementing classes are not forced to override the new method.');

INSERT INTO Quizzes (LessonTitle, QuestionText, OptionA, OptionB, OptionC, OptionD, CorrectAnswer, Explanation) VALUES 
('Interface in Java', 'If a class implements two interfaces that both define a ''default'' method with the exact same signature, what happens?', 'The compiler arbitrarily chooses one of the default implementations.', 'The program compiles, but throws a runtime exception if the method is called.', 'The compiler throws a compilation error requiring the implementing class to explicitly override the method and resolve the ambiguity.', 'The class inherits both methods and must call them sequentially.', 'C', 'This is Java''s version of the "Diamond Problem". The compiler forces the implementing class to override the conflicting method to explicitly define which behavior it should exhibit.');

INSERT INTO Quizzes (LessonTitle, QuestionText, OptionA, OptionB, OptionC, OptionD, CorrectAnswer, Explanation) VALUES 
('Interface in Java', 'How do you invoke a ''static'' method defined inside an interface named ''MyInterface''?', 'By instantiating an anonymous class of the interface and calling it.', 'By calling it on an instance of a class that implements the interface.', 'By prefixing the method name with the interface name, e.g., ''MyInterface.myStaticMethod()''.', 'Static methods are not allowed in interfaces.', 'C', 'Java 8 introduced static methods in interfaces. They belong to the interface itself and are invoked strictly using the interface name. Implementing classes do not inherit them.');

INSERT INTO Quizzes (LessonTitle, QuestionText, OptionA, OptionB, OptionC, OptionD, CorrectAnswer, Explanation) VALUES 
('Interface in Java', 'What is a "Marker Interface" in Java?', 'An interface that only contains default methods.', 'An interface that has exactly one abstract method.', 'An empty interface with no fields or methods, used to signal or "mark" a class to the JVM or a framework.', 'An interface used exclusively for logging and debugging markers.', 'C', 'A marker interface (like ''java.io.Serializable'' or ''java.lang.Cloneable'') contains no methods or fields. It provides run-time type information about objects, indicating they possess a certain property to the JVM or framework.');

INSERT INTO Quizzes (LessonTitle, QuestionText, OptionA, OptionB, OptionC, OptionD, CorrectAnswer, Explanation) VALUES 
('Interface in Java', 'Introduced in Java 9, what is the primary use case for ''private'' methods inside an interface?', 'To allow implementing classes to hide their internal state.', 'To encapsulate and share common helper logic between multiple ''default'' or ''static'' methods within the same interface.', 'To prevent an interface from being implemented by classes outside its package.', 'To define a constructor for the interface.', 'B', 'Private methods in interfaces (both static and instance) allow interface designers to extract shared code from default or static methods into private helper methods, improving code readability and reuse without exposing the helper logic to implementing classes.');

INSERT INTO Quizzes (LessonTitle, QuestionText, OptionA, OptionB, OptionC, OptionD, CorrectAnswer, Explanation) VALUES 
('Interface in Java', 'Which annotation is used to explicitly declare that an interface is intended to have exactly one abstract method, making it suitable for lambda expressions?', '@FunctionalInterface', '@SingleAbstractMethod', '@LambdaTarget', '@Override', 'A', 'The ''@FunctionalInterface'' annotation enforces a compiler check to ensure the interface has exactly one abstract method, aligning it with the requirements for lambda expressions and method references in Java.');
