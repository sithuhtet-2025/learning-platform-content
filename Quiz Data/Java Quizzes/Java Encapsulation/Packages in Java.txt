('Packages in Java', 'What is the primary function of utilizing packages in a Java application?', 'To increase the execution speed of the application.', 'To bypass the need for compiling source code.', 'To organize classes into namespaces, preventing naming collisions and managing access control.', 'To allow Java programs to run without the JVM.', 'C', 'Packages group related types (classes, interfaces, enumerations) providing namespace management. This allows two classes with the exact same name (e.g., ''Date'') to exist in the same project as long as they reside in different packages.');

('Packages in Java', 'What does the wildcard import statement ''import java.util.*;'' accomplish?', 'It imports all classes and all subpackages within the ''java.util'' package.', 'It imports only the ''java.util'' package itself, but none of its classes.', 'It imports all top-level classes and interfaces directly within the ''java.util'' package, but ignores subpackages like ''java.util.concurrent''.', 'It merges all files in ''java.util'' into a single compiled class.', 'C', 'The asterisk (*) wildcard imports all types (classes and interfaces) located directly within that specific package. It does NOT recursively import classes located within subpackages.');

('Packages in Java', 'What is the universally accepted naming convention for defining custom Java packages?', 'Capitalized words separated by underscores (e.g., My_Custom_Package).', 'CamelCase starting with a capital letter (e.g., MyCustomPackage).', 'All lowercase letters, typically structured as a reversed internet domain name (e.g., com.company.project).', 'Alphanumeric codes (e.g., pkg123).', 'C', 'To guarantee global uniqueness, the convention is to reverse the organization''s domain name and use all lowercase letters, followed by project and module names (e.g., ''org.apache.commons'').');

('Packages in Java', 'Where must the ''package'' declaration statement be placed within a Java source code file?', 'It can be placed anywhere before the class declaration.', 'It must be the absolute first line, preceding all import statements and class definitions (ignoring comments/whitespace).', 'It must be placed immediately after the ''import'' statements.', 'It is placed inside the ''main'' method.', 'B', 'If a class is part of a package, the ''package'' statement is strictly required to be the first executable line of code in the source file. Placing an ''import'' statement before it will cause a compilation error.');

INSERT INTO Quizzes (LessonTitle, QuestionText, OptionA, OptionB, OptionC, OptionD, CorrectAnswer, Explanation) VALUES 
('Packages in Java', 'What happens if you have two classes with the exact same name (e.g., ''Timer'') in two different packages, and you need to use both in the same file?', 'You can import both using wildcard imports, and the compiler will infer which one you mean based on context.', 'The compiler will reject the file; you must rename one of the classes.', 'You must import one class normally, and use the fully qualified package name (e.g., ''java.util.Timer'') every time you reference the second class.', 'Java automatically merges the two classes into one.', 'C', 'You cannot import two classes with identical names using single-type imports. To resolve the namespace collision, you can import one, but must refer to the other by its fully qualified name (including the package path) everywhere it is used in the code.');
