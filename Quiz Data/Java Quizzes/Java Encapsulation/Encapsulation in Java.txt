('Encapsulation in Java', 'What is the primary architectural goal of encapsulation in Object-Oriented Programming?', 'To enable multiple inheritance across different class hierarchies.', 'To bundle data (state) and methods (behavior) together while restricting direct external access to the internal data.', 'To compile Java code into platform-independent bytecode.', 'To create abstract templates that cannot be instantiated.', 'B', 'Encapsulation is the mechanism of wrapping data and the code acting on that data together as a single unit, specifically utilizing access modifiers to hide the internal state from unauthorized external manipulation.');

INSERT INTO Quizzes (LessonTitle, QuestionText, OptionA, OptionB, OptionC, OptionD, CorrectAnswer, Explanation) VALUES 
('Encapsulation in Java', 'How is data hiding conventionally implemented in a Java class to achieve encapsulation?', 'By declaring all variables and methods as ''public''.', 'By storing data in external files instead of variables.', 'By declaring class fields as ''private'' and providing ''public'' getter and setter methods to access and modify them.', 'By declaring the class itself as ''private''.', 'C', 'Standard Java encapsulation practice requires marking instance variables as ''private'' so they cannot be accessed directly using the dot operator, and exposing ''public'' methods (getters/setters) to control how the values are read or mutated.');

INSERT INTO Quizzes (LessonTitle, QuestionText, OptionA, OptionB, OptionC, OptionD, CorrectAnswer, Explanation) VALUES 
('Encapsulation in Java', 'What is a major benefit of using setter methods instead of allowing direct access to public fields?', 'It improves the execution speed of the JVM.', 'It automatically makes the class thread-safe.', 'It allows the class to enforce validation rules and maintain state integrity before updating a variable.', 'It prevents the variable from ever being changed.', 'C', 'Setters provide a controlled gateway. If a field like ''age'' must not be negative, the setter method can include logic to throw an exception or reject negative inputs, guaranteeing the object remains in a valid state.');

INSERT INTO Quizzes (LessonTitle, QuestionText, OptionA, OptionB, OptionC, OptionD, CorrectAnswer, Explanation) VALUES 
('Encapsulation in Java', 'How would you architect a strictly "read-only" class in Java using encapsulation principles?', 'By making all fields ''public'' and ''final''.', 'By providing getter methods but intentionally omitting setter methods for the private fields.', 'By throwing exceptions in the getter methods.', 'By declaring the class as ''abstract''.', 'B', 'A class becomes effectively read-only to external consumers if its internal state is marked ''private'' and it only exposes getter methods. Once initialized (usually via a constructor), the state cannot be modified externally.');

INSERT INTO Quizzes (LessonTitle, QuestionText, OptionA, OptionB, OptionC, OptionD, CorrectAnswer, Explanation) VALUES 
('Encapsulation in Java', 'Which concept is most closely related to, but distinct from, encapsulation?', 'Polymorphism, which bundles data.', 'Inheritance, which hides data.', 'Abstraction, which hides complex implementation details, whereas encapsulation hides the internal state/data.', 'Compilation, which converts data to bytecode.', 'C', 'While often used together, Abstraction focuses on hiding the complexity of the implementation (exposing "what" an object does), while Encapsulation focuses on restricting access to the internal state/data (hiding "how" the data is stored).');

INSERT INTO Quizzes (LessonTitle, QuestionText, OptionA, OptionB, OptionC, OptionD, CorrectAnswer, Explanation) VALUES 
('Encapsulation in Java', 'If a Java Bean adheres to standard encapsulation, what naming convention must its accessor method for a boolean property named ''isActive'' follow?', 'getIsActive()', 'active()', 'isActive()', 'checkActive()', 'C', 'According to Java Bean conventions, the accessor method for a ''boolean'' property can use the ''is'' prefix instead of ''get''. Therefore, ''isActive()'' is the standard getter name for a boolean property named ''isActive'' or ''active''.');
