Encapsulation acts at the implementation level to protect data integrity (e.g., making variables private and providing setters).');

('OOPs Concepts in Java', 'Why does Java intentionally prohibit multiple inheritance of state (a class extending more than one parent class)?', 'To prevent memory leaks in the heap.', 'To avoid the "Diamond Problem" where a subclass inherits ambiguous or conflicting method implementations from multiple parent classes.', 'Because it is mathematically impossible to compile.', 'To ensure all classes are strictly sealed.', 'B', 'Java avoids the complexity and ambiguity of the Diamond Problem. If a class inherited from two parents that both defined an identical method, the compiler would not know which one to execute. Java uses multiple interface implementation instead to avoid state conflicts.');

For example, if a ''Dog'' class extends an ''Animal'' class, then a Dog "IS-A" Animal. This guarantees the subclass can stand in for the parent class.');

A method accepting an ''Animal'' reference can seamlessly accept and execute overridden behaviors for ''Dog'', ''Cat'', or any future subclasses added later without changing the original method''s code.');
