The JVM allocates memory for static variables only once during class loading, making them shared class-level variables.');

('Java static keyword', 'Why is it impossible to use the ''this'' or ''super'' keywords inside a ''static'' method?', 'Because static methods are compiled before instance methods.', 'Because ''this'' and ''super'' are strictly tied to specific object instances, and static methods belong to the class and are executed without requiring an object instance.', 'Because static methods can only access other static members.', 'Because it violates encapsulation principles.', 'B', 'The keywords ''this'' (current instance) and ''super'' (parent instance) require an object context. Since static methods are invoked on the class level without an instantiated object, there is no instance context for these keywords to reference.');

The JVM executes them sequentially in the order they appear in the source code as soon as the class is loaded into memory, long before object instantiation.');

('Java static keyword', 'Can a ''static'' method be overridden in Java to achieve runtime polymorphism?', 'Yes, static methods override just like instance methods.', 'Yes, but only if the subclass is also declared static.', 'No, declaring a static method with the same signature in a subclass performs "Method Hiding", which is resolved at compile time (static binding) rather than runtime.', 'No, because static methods cannot be inherited by subclasses.', 'C', 'Static methods are bound statically at compile time. While a subclass can define a static method with the exact same signature as a parent class, it merely hides the parent method. Polymorphic runtime resolution (overriding) does not occur.');

('Java static keyword', 'What happens if a ''static'' method attempts to directly access a non-static instance variable of the same class?', 'The compiler automatically instantiates an anonymous object to access the variable.', 'The program compiles but throws a NullPointerException at runtime.', 'The compiler throws an error stating that a non-static variable cannot be referenced from a static context.', 'The variable is temporarily treated as static for the duration of the method.', 'C', 'Instance variables require a specific object to exist in memory. Because static methods can be called without any object instantiation, the compiler prevents them from directly accessing instance variables to avoid referencing non-existent data.');

It cannot be applied to top-level outer classes, constructors, or local variables.');
