Access modifiers cannot be used for local inner classes.', 'All four access modifiers are permitted.', 'C', 'A local inner class behaves similarly to a local variable. Because its scope is strictly confined to the block in which it is declared, access modifiers (public, private, protected) are illegal and meaningless.');

('Java Local inner class', 'What is the maximum scope (visibility) of a Local Inner Class?', 'It is visible to all methods within the enclosing class.', 'It is visible to subclasses of the enclosing class.', 'It is strictly visible and instantiable only within the block of code where it is defined.', 'It is visible anywhere within the same package.', 'C', 'The type definition of a local inner class is hidden entirely from the outside world and even from other methods within the same class. It can only be instantiated within the exact block where it is defined.');

('Java Local inner class', 'If a Local Inner Class is defined inside a ''static'' method, what restriction applies to it regarding the outer class?', 'It cannot be instantiated at all.', 'It must also be declared with the ''static'' keyword.', 'It cannot access any instance (non-static) members of the enclosing outer class.', 'It is forced to implement the Serializable interface.', 'C', 'When a local inner class is declared within a static block or static method, it does not receive an implicit reference to an outer instance (because there is no outer instance in a static context). Therefore, it can only access the static members of the enclosing class.');
