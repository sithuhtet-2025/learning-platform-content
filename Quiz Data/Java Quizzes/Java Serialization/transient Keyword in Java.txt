Its value will not be written to the output stream when the object is serialized.');

When the object is deserialized, the JVM simply initializes the skipped transient field to its standard data type default, which is 0 for an ''int''.');

('transient Keyword in Java', 'What happens if you apply the ''transient'' keyword to a variable that is also declared as ''static''?', 'The compiler throws an "illegal modifier combination" error.', 'The variable is serialized normally, overriding the transient instruction.', 'The ''transient'' keyword has absolutely no effect, because static variables belong to the class and are inherently never serialized with the object state anyway.', 'The static variable is reset to its default value across all instances.', 'C', 'Serialization only saves the state of individual object instances. Because ''static'' variables belong to the class level and not the instance level, they are automatically excluded from the serialization process. Adding ''transient'' to a static variable is redundant and ignored.');

Applying it to classes, methods, or local variables will result in a compile-time syntax error.');
