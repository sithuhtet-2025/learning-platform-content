('Method Overloading in Java', 'Can you overload a method in Java purely by changing its return type?', 'Yes, as long as the return types are not covariant.', 'No, changing the return type alone is insufficient and will cause a compilation error indicating a duplicate method.', 'Yes, but only if one method returns a primitive and the other returns an object.', 'No, the return type must always remain exactly the same.', 'B', 'The Java compiler uses the method signature (name and parameter list) to distinguish between overloaded methods. The return type is not part of the method signature. Therefore, changing only the return type results in an ambiguous duplicate method error.');

('Method Overloading in Java', 'If a class has overloaded methods ''print(int x)'' and ''print(double x)'', what happens if you call ''print(5)''?', 'The compiler throws an ambiguous method call error.', 'It calls ''print(double x)'' because double is a larger data type.', 'It explicitly calls ''print(int x)'' because 5 is an integer literal and perfectly matches the int parameter.', 'It executes both methods sequentially.', 'C', 'The compiler looks for the most specific and exact match first. Since 5 is an ''int'' literal, ''print(int x)'' is a perfect match and is statically bound to the call.');

('Method Overloading in Java', 'How does method overloading interact with varargs (variable-length arguments) like ''void display(int... numbers)''?', 'Varargs cannot be overloaded.', 'A method with varargs is always prioritized over a method with specific arguments.', 'The compiler treats vararg methods as the lowest priority, matching them only if no exact or implicitly widened match is found.', 'Varargs throw a runtime exception if overloaded.', 'C', 'When resolving overloaded methods, the compiler first looks for exact matches, then widening conversions, then autoboxing/unboxing. Varargs are evaluated last, acting as a fallback to prevent ambiguity.');
