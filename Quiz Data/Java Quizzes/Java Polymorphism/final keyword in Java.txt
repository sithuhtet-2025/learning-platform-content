Security-sensitive or immutable classes, like ''java.lang.String'', are declared final to prevent malicious or accidental alteration of their behavior via subclasses.');

('final keyword in Java', 'If a method in a superclass is declared as ''final'', what restriction is placed on subclasses?', 'Subclasses must overload the method.', 'Subclasses must override the method.', 'Subclasses cannot override the method.', 'Subclasses cannot call the method.', 'C', 'Marking a method as ''final'' locks its implementation. It prevents any inheriting subclass from overriding or altering the behavior of that specific method.');

('final keyword in Java', 'What is a "blank final" variable in Java?', 'A final variable initialized to null.', 'A final variable that is declared but not initialized at the time of declaration, and must be initialized within the constructor.', 'A final variable that has no data type.', 'A final variable that can be reassigned exactly once.', 'B', 'A blank final variable is a final instance variable whose declaration lacks an initial value. Java mandates that a blank final variable must be definitively assigned a value in every constructor of the class before the object is fully created.');

('final keyword in Java', 'Is it syntactically legal to declare a constructor as ''final''?', 'Yes, to prevent subclassing.', 'Yes, to make it thread-safe.', 'No, constructors cannot be inherited, so marking them ''final'' is meaningless and causes a compilation error.', 'Yes, but only in abstract classes.', 'C', 'Constructors are not inherited by subclasses; therefore, they cannot be overridden. Applying the ''final'' modifier (which prevents overriding) to a constructor is illegal and will be rejected by the compiler.');

INSERT INTO Quizzes (LessonTitle, QuestionText, OptionA, OptionB, OptionC, OptionD, CorrectAnswer, Explanation) VALUES 
('final keyword in Java', 'Consider the declaration: ''final StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Java");''. Which of the following operations is legally permitted?', 'sb = new StringBuilder("Python");', 'sb = null;', 'sb.append(" Programming");', 'None of the above. The object is completely immutable.', 'C', 'When applied to an object reference, ''final'' prevents the reference variable from pointing to a different object in memory. However, it does NOT make the object itself immutable. You can still modify the internal state of the ''StringBuilder'' object.');

('final keyword in Java', 'If a method parameter is declared as ''final'' (e.g., ''public void print(final int x)''), what does this enforce?', 'The argument passed to the method must be a constant literal.', 'The variable ''x'' cannot be reassigned a new value within the body of the method.', 'The method cannot return a value.', 'The method passes the parameter by reference rather than by value.', 'B', 'A final parameter implies that once the method is invoked and the argument is bound to the parameter variable, the parameter variable acts as a constant and cannot be reassigned within the method block.');
