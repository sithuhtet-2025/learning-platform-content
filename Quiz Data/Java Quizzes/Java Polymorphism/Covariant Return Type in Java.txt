('Covariant Return Type in Java', 'What happens if a subclass attempts to override a parent method returning ''List'' with a method returning ''Object''?', 'It compiles and runs successfully.', 'It throws a runtime exception.', 'It throws a compilation error because ''Object'' is a supertype, not a subtype, of ''List''.', 'The return type is implicitly cast to ''List''.', 'C', 'When overriding, you can only narrow the return type down the inheritance tree (covariant), not widen it up the tree (contravariant). ''Object'' is higher in the hierarchy than ''List'', so this violates overriding rules.');
