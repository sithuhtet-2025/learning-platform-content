Because ''private'', ''final'', and ''static'' methods cannot be overridden by subclasses, the compiler knows exactly which method implementation will be executed without needing to check the object type at runtime.');

('Static and Dynamic Binding in Java', 'When does Dynamic Binding (Late Binding) occur in a Java application?', 'During the compilation phase by the ''javac'' compiler.', 'When the source code is being parsed.', 'During runtime, when the JVM determines the actual object instance being referred to.', 'Only when the JVM is garbage collecting.', 'C', 'Dynamic binding occurs at runtime. The JVM determines the actual type of the object in memory (not just its reference variable type) and binds the method call to the overridden method implementation belonging to that specific object type.');

INSERT INTO Quizzes (LessonTitle, QuestionText, OptionA, OptionB, OptionC, OptionD, CorrectAnswer, Explanation) VALUES 
('Static and Dynamic Binding in Java', 'Why does Java use Static Binding for overloaded methods?', 'Because overloaded methods are always private.', 'Because the JVM cannot distinguish between different parameter types at runtime.', 'Because the compiler can definitively determine the correct method to call based on the number and compile-time types of the arguments provided in the source code.', 'Because overloaded methods must be marked as ''final''.', 'C', 'Method overloading is resolved entirely at compile time. The compiler inspects the reference types of the arguments passed to the method and statically binds the call to the overloaded method signature that matches those types.');

INSERT INTO Quizzes (LessonTitle, QuestionText, OptionA, OptionB, OptionC, OptionD, CorrectAnswer, Explanation) VALUES 
('Static and Dynamic Binding in Java', 'Regarding performance, what is generally true about Static versus Dynamic Binding?', 'Dynamic binding is faster because it uses modern CPU instructions.', 'Static binding is marginally faster because the method resolution is completed before the program even runs, avoiding a runtime vtable lookup.', 'There is absolutely no performance difference in modern JVMs.', 'Static binding is slower because it increases the size of the compiled bytecode.', 'B', 'Static binding has a slight performance advantage. Because the exact method body is known at compile time, the JVM does not need to perform dynamic lookups (like checking virtual method tables) during execution to figure out which code to run.');
