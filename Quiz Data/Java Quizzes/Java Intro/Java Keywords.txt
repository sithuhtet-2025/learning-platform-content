('Java Keywords', 'Which two keywords are reserved by the Java language but are currently unused and have no function?', 'goto and const', 'sizeof and typedef', 'friend and virtual', 'yield and var', 'A', 'Java reserves ''goto'' and ''const'' to prevent their use as identifiers, primarily to avoid confusion for C/C++ programmers transitioning to Java, but they hold no functional implementation in the language.');

INSERT INTO Quizzes (LessonTitle, QuestionText, OptionA, OptionB, OptionC, OptionD, CorrectAnswer, Explanation) VALUES 
('Java Keywords', 'Introduced in Java 10, ''var'' is used for local variable type inference. Technically, what is its classification in the Java language?', 'It is a strict reserved keyword.', 'It is a primitive data type.', 'It is a contextual keyword (or reserved type name).', 'It is an access modifier.', 'C', '''var'' is not a strict keyword. It is a "contextual keyword" or reserved type name. This means you can still legally use ''var'' as a variable or method name, but it acts as a keyword when used as a type declaration for local variables.');

INSERT INTO Quizzes (LessonTitle, QuestionText, OptionA, OptionB, OptionC, OptionD, CorrectAnswer, Explanation) VALUES 
('Java Keywords', 'What is the primary purpose of the ''transient'' keyword in Java?', 'To mark a method that can be accessed by multiple threads simultaneously.', 'To prevent a variable from being serialized when the object is converted to a byte stream.', 'To indicate that a variable''s value will be stored in CPU cache rather than RAM.', 'To define a variable that cannot be reassigned after initialization.', 'B', 'The ''transient'' keyword is used in object serialization. If a field is declared as transient, its value will not be persisted when the object state is serialized (e.g., written to a file or network).');

INSERT INTO Quizzes (LessonTitle, QuestionText, OptionA, OptionB, OptionC, OptionD, CorrectAnswer, Explanation) VALUES 
('Java Keywords', 'Are ''true'', ''false'', and ''null'' considered reserved keywords in Java?', 'Yes, they are strict keywords used for control flow.', 'No, they are technically boolean and reference literals, though they cannot be used as identifiers.', 'Yes, but only in Java 8 and newer.', 'No, they can be freely used as variable names.', 'B', 'Technically, the Java Language Specification categorizes ''true'', ''false'', and ''null'' as literals, not keywords. However, like keywords, you are strictly prohibited from using them as identifiers (variable, class, or method names).');
