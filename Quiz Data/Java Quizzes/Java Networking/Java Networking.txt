('Java Networking', 'What is the primary role of the ''ServerSocket'' class in a Java TCP application?', 'To initiate a connection request to a remote server.', 'To listen for incoming client connection requests on a specific port and generate a ''Socket'' object upon successful connection.', 'To encrypt the data payload before transmission.', 'To route packets through the network layer.', 'B', 'The ''ServerSocket'' runs on the server machine, bound to a specific port. Its primary job is to listen for incoming connection requests from clients and, upon accepting one via the ''accept()'' method, return a standard ''Socket'' object to handle the actual two-way communication.');

INSERT INTO Quizzes (LessonTitle, QuestionText, OptionA, OptionB, OptionC, OptionD, CorrectAnswer, Explanation) VALUES 
('Java Networking', 'What happens when a Java server calls the ''accept()'' method on a ''ServerSocket'' instance?', 'The server immediately sends a broadcast message to all clients.', 'The thread running the ''accept()'' method blocks (pauses execution) until a client successfully connects.', 'The server closes the port and refuses further connections.', 'It returns a boolean indicating if the port is open.', 'B', 'The ''accept()'' method is a blocking call. It will halt the execution of its thread and wait indefinitely until a client attempts to connect to the ServerSocket''s port.');

('Java Networking', 'Once a TCP ''Socket'' connection is established between a client and a server, how is data actually transferred between them in Java?', 'Using DatagramPackets.', 'By directly manipulating the CPU''s network registers.', 'Through an ''InputStream'' to receive data and an ''OutputStream'' to send data.', 'By passing File objects through the socket channel.', 'C', 'A connected TCP ''Socket'' provides a two-way communication channel. You call ''getInputStream()'' to read data sent by the remote end, and ''getOutputStream()'' to write data to be sent to the remote end.');

INSERT INTO Quizzes (LessonTitle, QuestionText, OptionA, OptionB, OptionC, OptionD, CorrectAnswer, Explanation) VALUES 
('Java Networking', 'Which of the following port numbers is generally safe and recommended to bind a custom Java server application to, avoiding standard well-known service conflicts?', 'Port 80', 'Port 21', 'Port 443', 'Port 8080', 'D', 'Ports 0-1023 are "well-known ports" reserved for standard protocols (80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS, 21 for FTP). Custom applications should bind to registered or dynamic ports, typically in the range of 1024 to 65535, such as 8080.');

INSERT INTO Quizzes (LessonTitle, QuestionText, OptionA, OptionB, OptionC, OptionD, CorrectAnswer, Explanation) VALUES 
('Java Networking', 'What is the consequence of calling ''close()'' on a ''Socket'' object?', 'It flushes the output stream but leaves the connection open for reading.', 'It closes both the InputStream and OutputStream, and terminates the underlying TCP connection.', 'It only closes the network interface on the client side; the server must time out.', 'It resets the socket to be used for a new connection.', 'B', 'Closing a socket strictly releases the system resources associated with it. It terminates the TCP connection and automatically closes the socket''s associated ''InputStream'' and ''OutputStream''. A closed socket cannot be reconnected.');
