Once a client connects, the ''ServerSocket'' spawns a regular ''Socket'' object, which is then used by the server to read from and write to that specific client.');

INSERT INTO Quizzes (LessonTitle, QuestionText, OptionA, OptionB, OptionC, OptionD, CorrectAnswer, Explanation) VALUES 
('Java Socket Programming', 'Why is it critical to call ''flush()'' on the ''OutputStream'' (or its wrapper, like ''PrintWriter'') when sending data through a Socket?', 'It explicitly closes the socket connection after the data is sent.', 'It encrypts the data buffer before transmission.', 'It forces any buffered data to be immediately written and pushed across the network to the receiving socket.', 'It resets the stream to the beginning of the file.', 'C', 'Network streams are heavily buffered by the OS and JVM to improve efficiency. Calling ''flush()'' ensures that data sitting in the local buffer is actually pushed out over the TCP connection without waiting for the buffer to fill up.');

('Java Socket Programming', 'If the remote client unexpectedly crashes or drops the connection without a proper TCP teardown, what happens when the Java server attempts to read from the socket''s ''InputStream''?', 'The ''read()'' method returns null.', 'The ''read()'' method blocks indefinitely.', 'An EOFException is always thrown.', 'A java.net.SocketException (e.g., "Connection reset") is thrown.', 'D', 'If the underlying TCP connection is broken ungracefully, attempting to read from or write to the socket streams will typically result in a ''SocketException'', notifying the application that the connection was reset or broken by the peer.');
