('Java Programs', 'Why must the ''main'' method be declared as ''static'' in a Java program?', 'To allow the garbage collector to manage it efficiently.', 'So the compiler can verify its syntax before runtime.', 'Because the JVM must invoke it without needing to instantiate an object of the class first.', 'To prevent the method from being overridden by subclasses.', 'C', 'Because the ''main'' method is the entry point, no objects exist yet when the program starts. Declaring it ''static'' allows the JVM to call the method directly on the class itself.');

('Java Programs', 'What is the strict rule regarding the naming of a Java source file containing a ''public'' class?', 'The file name must be entirely lowercase.', 'The file name must match the name of the ''public'' class exactly, appended with the ''.java'' extension.', 'The file name must match the package name.', 'There are no strict rules; the compiler maps it automatically.', 'B', 'Java dictates that a source file can contain at most one ''public'' class, and the filename must perfectly match that class name, including case sensitivity, with a ''.java'' extension.');

('Java Programs', 'Which command is used via the Command Line Interface (CLI) to compile a Java source file into bytecode?', 'java', 'javaw', 'compile', 'javac', 'D', 'The ''javac'' (Java Compiler) command is used to compile ''.java'' source code files into ''.class'' bytecode files, which can then be executed by the JVM.');

INSERT INTO Quizzes (LessonTitle, QuestionText, OptionA, OptionB, OptionC, OptionD, CorrectAnswer, Explanation) VALUES 
('Java Programs', 'If a Java source file contains a ''package'' declaration, where must it be located?', 'At the very end of the file.', 'Immediately before the class declaration.', 'It must be the first non-comment, non-whitespace line in the source file.', 'Inside the ''main'' method.', 'C', 'Java requires that if a class belongs to a package, the ''package'' declaration must strictly be the first line of code in the file, preceding any import statements or class definitions.');

INSERT INTO Quizzes (LessonTitle, QuestionText, OptionA, OptionB, OptionC, OptionD, CorrectAnswer, Explanation) VALUES 
('Java Programs', 'What happens if you attempt to run a compiled Java class (using the ''java'' command) that does not contain a ''main'' method?', 'The program executes but terminates immediately without output.', 'The program falls back to the default constructor and executes it.', 'A ''NoSuchMethodError: main'' runtime error is thrown by the JVM.', 'The compiler prevents the class from compiling in the first place.', 'C', 'A class without a ''main'' method can be successfully compiled (as it might be a library or helper class), but attempting to execute it directly will cause the JVM to throw an error since it cannot find the entry point.');

INSERT INTO Quizzes (LessonTitle, QuestionText, OptionA, OptionB, OptionC, OptionD, CorrectAnswer, Explanation) VALUES 
('Java Programs', 'Can a single ''.java'' source file contain multiple class definitions?', 'No, a file can strictly contain only one class.', 'Yes, but all classes within the file must be declared as ''public''.', 'Yes, it can contain multiple classes, but at most one of them can be declared ''public''.', 'Yes, and there is no restriction on how many can be ''public''.', 'C', 'A single Java file can contain multiple classes (often used for tightly coupled helper classes), but the compiler enforces that only one class per file can have the ''public'' access modifier.');
