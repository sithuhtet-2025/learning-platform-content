('continue Statement in Java', 'Where is it syntactically legal to use a ''continue'' statement in Java?', 'Inside any block of code.', 'Only inside loops (''for'', ''while'', ''do-while'').', 'Inside loops and ''switch'' statements.', 'Only inside ''if-else'' statements.', 'B', 'The ''continue'' statement can only be used inside the body of a loop.
