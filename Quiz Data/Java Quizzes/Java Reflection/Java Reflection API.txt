You must obtain a Class object (e.g., via Class.forName() or obj.getClass()) before you can reflectively access its constructors, methods, or fields.');

INSERT INTO Quizzes (LessonTitle, QuestionText, OptionA, OptionB, OptionC, OptionD, CorrectAnswer, Explanation) VALUES 
('Java Reflection API', 'What is a significant drawback of using Reflection heavily in a production Java application?', 'It prevents the application from compiling.', 'It restricts the application to only running on the specific OS it was compiled on.', 'It incurs a significant performance overhead compared to direct method invocation.', 'It strictly requires the application to be signed with a security certificate.', 'C', 'Reflection involves dynamic resolution of types, methods, and access control checks at runtime, preventing the JVM from performing many standard optimizations. This makes reflective operations noticeably slower than their direct, compiled counterparts.');

INSERT INTO Quizzes (LessonTitle, QuestionText, OptionA, OptionB, OptionC, OptionD, CorrectAnswer, Explanation) VALUES 
('Java Reflection API', 'What is the difference between the ''getFields()'' and ''getDeclaredFields()'' methods on a Class object?', '''getFields()'' returns all fields (including private), while ''getDeclaredFields()'' returns only fields explicitly declared in the class hierarchy.', '''getFields()'' returns all public fields (including inherited ones), while ''getDeclaredFields()'' returns all fields declared by the class itself (including private), but not inherited ones.', 'There is no difference; they are aliases for the same operation.', '''getDeclaredFields()'' only returns fields marked with the ''final'' keyword.', 'B', '''getFields()'' is limited to public visibility but traverses the inheritance tree. ''getDeclaredFields()'' ignores visibility (returning private, protected, etc.) but strictly limits its scope to the fields physically written inside that specific class declaration.');
