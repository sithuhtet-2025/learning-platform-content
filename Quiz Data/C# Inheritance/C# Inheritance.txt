Unlike Java (extends) or VB.NET (Inherits), C# uses a single colon for both class inheritance and interface implementation.');

('C# Inheritance', 'Which access modifier allows a member to be accessible within its own class and by derived class instances, but not by unrelated classes?', 'private', 'internal', 'protected', 'private protected', 'C', 'The protected keyword ensures that a member is visible only within its own class and any class that inherits from it, facilitating encapsulation within the inheritance hierarchy.');

INSERT INTO Quizzes (LessonTitle, QuestionText, OptionA, OptionB, OptionC, OptionD, CorrectAnswer, Explanation) VALUES 
('C# Inheritance', 'In C#, can a class inherit from multiple base classes simultaneously?', 'Yes, C# supports multiple class inheritance.', 'No, a class can only inherit from one base class.', 'Yes, but only if the base classes are abstract.', 'Yes, but only if the base classes have no constructors.', 'B', 'C# does not support multiple inheritance of classes to avoid the ''Diamond Problem'' and complexity. A class can inherit from only one base class, though it can implement multiple interfaces.');

INSERT INTO Quizzes (LessonTitle, QuestionText, OptionA, OptionB, OptionC, OptionD, CorrectAnswer, Explanation) VALUES 
('C# Inheritance', 'What is the purpose of the ''virtual'' keyword when applied to a method in a base class?', 'It prevents the method from being overridden in derived classes.', 'It forces the derived class to provide an implementation.', 'It indicates that the method can be overridden in a derived class.', 'It makes the method accessible only to the base class.', 'C', 'The virtual keyword allows a method, property, or event to be overridden in any derived class. Without virtual (or abstract), a method is considered non-virtual and cannot be overridden using the override keyword.');

INSERT INTO Quizzes (LessonTitle, QuestionText, OptionA, OptionB, OptionC, OptionD, CorrectAnswer, Explanation) VALUES 
('C# Inheritance', 'How can a derived class constructor explicitly call a specific constructor of the base class?', 'By using the ''parent'' keyword.', 'By calling Base.Constructor() inside the method body.', 'By using the ''base'' keyword followed by parameters in the constructor initializer.', 'Base class constructors are called automatically and cannot be specified.', 'C', 'The : base(...) syntax in the constructor initializer list allows a derived class to pass arguments to a specific base class constructor. This is executed before the body of the derived constructor.');

('C# Inheritance', 'Which keyword is used to prevent a class from being inherited by any other class?', 'static', 'sealed', 'abstract', 'final', 'B', 'A sealed class cannot be used as a base class. This is often used for security reasons or to prevent unintended extensions of a class''s behavior.');

('C# Inheritance', 'If a derived class defines a method with the same name and signature as a base class method without using ''override'' or ''new'', what happens?', 'A compile-time error occurs.', 'The code compiles, but a warning is issued and the base method is hidden (shadowed).', 'The base method is automatically overridden.', 'The program crashes at runtime.', 'B', 'C# defaults to shadowing (hiding) if a matching signature is found. The compiler issues a warning suggesting the use of the ''new'' keyword if hiding is intended, or ''override'' if polymorphism is intended.');

INSERT INTO Quizzes (LessonTitle, QuestionText, OptionA, OptionB, OptionC, OptionD, CorrectAnswer, Explanation) VALUES 
('C# Inheritance', 'What is the effect of applying the ''sealed'' modifier to a method that has been overridden in a derived class?', 'The method can no longer be called by instances of the derived class.', 'The method cannot be overridden further by any classes inheriting from this derived class.', 'The method becomes private automatically.', 'The method can now only be accessed via the base class reference.', 'B', 'When you override a virtual method, you can mark it as sealed. This allows the class to participate in inheritance while stopping that specific method from being modified further down the hierarchy.');

('C# Inheritance', 'Which of the following classes is the ultimate base class for every class in the .NET ecosystem?', 'System.Base', 'System.Root', 'System.Object', 'System.Class', 'C', 'System.Object is the root of the type hierarchy. Even if a class does not explicitly inherit from another class, it implicitly inherits from System.Object, gaining methods like ToString(), Equals(), and GetType().');
